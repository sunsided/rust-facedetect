# OpenCV Face Detection in Rust

An experiment with [opencv-rust](https://github.com/twistedfall/opencv-rust) and
basically not much more than the multi-scale face detection demo
(using a frontal-face [Haar cascade](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html))
on the first video capture device that can be found. 

To run it, execute

```bash
cargo run
```

To exit, press `ESC`.
